Based on SQL logic below we are only interested in BORR_ID and ENTERPRISE_CUSTOMER_NUM from DD_BORROWER. It doesn't look like very active table in terms of DML activity based on MODE_LST_UPDT_DTTM. I think we should create combined index on BORR_ID and ENTERPRISE_CUSTOMER_NUM and test performance of this SQL in SPL(with PROD volume). With index in place it will do INDEX FAST FULL SCAN on smaller index segment compared to entire table and will improve response time of this SQL.

The key SLA of this ETL is to ensure all transactions are being persisted through our downstream to the analytical user repository area on a daily bases (running every 2 hours)  which today sends data to both our SASGRID1 and MIDE environments.  All of Acquisition Credit Risk Management is expecting this SLA to be maintained which agrees to have all transactions processed via our the Decision Engine Services (i.e. GRD  RED  etc.) base on the data specified (per mapping requirements)  and to be parsed and passed down to our analytic repositories every 2 hours accurately.   When data is not parsed/passed to our downstream repositories correctly  as per our SLA to process daily (every 2 hours)  this causes a high risk to our credit risk assessments due to the inability to report against correct data that is supposed to represent each actual transaction that is passed through our decision environment accurately. This risk can create a substantial loss of money for the company due to invalid credit risk modeling  incorrect risk evaluations  and risk towards making new changes that do not factor in all data  due to ETL delays or server issues.  Quality and accurately is our key expectations for this data flowing through this ETL  to avoid repurchases and to help the company stay ahead with regulatory Federal Credit Policies. Therefore if and when data is delayed due to a technology limitation  which halts this ETL and can cause a greater risk of missing data  this can have a ripple effect throughout our company's compliance and operational risk organization.  1458051437u414337 Status changed to Closed  RESOLUTION: CAUSE GROUP :: MODE DBA TEAM RESOLUTION :: COMMENT OUT THAT MAINTENANCE JOB THAT IS LEAKING MEMORY.,4,5,UPDATES ON HULA TRANSACTION OLD IMPACTING PRODUCTION DATABASE HEAVILY,1456326962,414337,,DESCRIPTION: New Submission1456327322u414337 Status changed to In Progress  DESCRIPTION: UPDATES ON HULA TRANSACTION OLD IMPACTING PRODUCTION DATABASE HEAVILY  Problem was assigned to u,Pending Comments: Awaiting Change/Release   Status changed to Pending1456529540n843870Pending Comments: CR for a release of 3/11.1457120750n,RESOLUTION: CAUSE GROUP :: MODE DBA TEAM RESOLUTION :: COMMENT OUT THAT MAINTENANCE JOB THAT IS LEAKING MEMORY.,MODE-PlatformSupport,MODE-PlatformSupport,Closed,2/24/16 10:16,3/15/16 10:17,23824614,Application Client Server,MODE,,CAUSE GROUP :: MODE DBA TEAM RESOLUTION :: COMMENT OUT THAT MAINTENANCE JOB THAT IS LEAKING MEMORY.,MODE-PlatformSupport,u414337,1446818797NETCOOLcltaiprodetl 11/06/2015 08:05:46 CST/CDT [PC3]MODE.HMF.IMAGING_KOFAX_MODE_STG_TO_COM_DELTA--JOBFAILURE alarm has been generated  Problem was assigned to ntfymodeplatformsupp as a severity 4 problem.

The credit reporting history all comes from the same location which is a system called Axis that is within Rumba.  The below credit code of ""CO"" also exists in our WHFM portfolio for credit reporting history. However  the below translation of this CO code of ""NON GOVERNMENT MOD IN EFFECT"" is the what should translate on a WFHM loan not a Shaw loan. The correct translation of this code for Shaw should be ""Loan modified.""  In very simplistic terms  perhaps the comments of these code translations are crossed with the WFHM ones on this particular code?   Ellen had provided additional detailed information regarding this that should be tied to the PB Ticket for you to reference.

For these Loans  Initially core has sent with PRICE_QUOTE_DATE_TIME greater than May 5th and with no funding date  Hence mode extracted those records and sent to POP. But later  Seems like Core has updated the PRICE_QUOTE_DATE_TIME to less than May 5th which caused all these loan to excluded from our query and sent as ""deletes"" to POP without any update on the FUNDING DATE. See below for the current values of price quote date time.

For example  if response data name contains text 'AUTHORIZEDPRICE' then MODE will pick its corresponding value as auth price.  MODE has not received any response data in AIP_SERVICE_RESPONSE table for these 2 loans from CORE. Hence MODE has populated these fields as BLANK.

Pending Comments: waiting for Lori S White   Carol Mahan and Michael S Rumble from HR system for root cause analysis on missing file on date 7/11 and 7/13.1436821211AR_ESCALATORSent follow-up date notification to assignee1436994386a111375Root Cause analysis :   The root cause was file contention.  We send the NSE files to the DTS prod server using our DTS UID.  That DTS UID is then linked to 20 of our requesting groups.  This saves us from sending the file multiple times and hands it over to DTS to do the broadcast transmission to all the DTS UIDs linked by our DTS UID.  Well  we reached our max limit of 20 groups so we had to set up another DTS UID for our next 20  so to speak.  I added the second NDM of the same NSE file to our current NDM job.  NDM sends the first command to send the particular NSE file and then right after that  another step to send the same NSE file to the second DTS UID.  The first transmission was still in progress when the second NDM command attempted to send the same file to the second DTS UID  Hence  the file contention issue.    I made the change yesterday so that this will not happen in the future.  I copied the NSE file to a secondary name and changed the NDM to reference this secondary name so there is no file contention - there are 2 identical files being sent to DTS with different UIDs.  The change goes into production on Monday  7/20.  If we do hiccup again before that happens  I will have operations re-send the file to the DTS UID that ""lost"" in the NDM war.  I apologize for any problems this may have caused on your side.

CORE 1 CLEAN UP REQUIRED AT MODE SIDE TO AVOID  MANUAL FILTERING OF CORE 1 DATA ON NIGHTLY RUN . 1432306914X787070Capital Markets Credit Risk (CMCR) technology  also sometimes referred to as Capital Markets Integrated Environment (CMIE) for its DB environment  is a new downstream partner that started receiving data from MODE on 5/16. Since then  we have discovered the main job that sends data to CMIE takes three hours when running sequentially but only 18-30 minutes running in parallel. This change will fix that job so it can be delivered on time to meet OLAs. When it was taking three hours  CMCR missed a couple of deadlines that led to impacts for downstream partners MIDE and CMODS.  Perhaps even more importantly  we also discovered CORE1 data was being sent to Capital Markets and this old data is not only not needed but causing errors for the loans provided to business partners. This causes big financial impact. PRB000022425353 covers both these issues.   ECR was installed 5/21 and first two C2C jobs were done in 18 and 19 minutes respectively. CMIE also not seeing issues with CORE1 data in new feed.  PRB to be closed after CR is fully approved.

Processing of these updates on MODE has taken much longer than experienced during SIT testing.  500 trail files were processed in roughly 12 hours.  300 trail files remain with a throughput of roughly 1 minute each.  Assuming the processing rate holds consistent we expect it to complete by 4pm CT.  Upon its completion the source schema needs synched (estimated at 1 hour).  Expectation was for the above processing to complete before noon.  Upon completion of the sync then the S2C Ab Initio process will kick off  currently expected around 5pm CT.  When this was tested in SIT we only experienced around 3 hours total lag on MODE.  PFIX for MODE does not currently allow a relevant test as the environment is not representative of PROD.  Additional information regarding this issue and changes made during dry run deployments in PFIX environments is attached here.

There is now only one non-interval partitioned segment on tables ACT  DOCVERSION  GENERIC  LNK  REQ  and REQ_DOC.  The drop partition job is passed a parameter telling whether to look at interval or non-interval partitioned segments.  The drop partition job avoids dropping what it sees as the only partition left and returns this error.  We can discuss the options at the morning meeting.  Options at this point: 1. Disable drop partition jobs for this schema until R3.15 when COM_DOC_NOTIFS will be recreated from scratch. a. The business agreed to this in June even though it means the extracts from this schema will work progressively slower until R3.15 deploy. b.

The authentication would take place on the Windows host so the access would need to be allowed there  with a listening SFTP service.  Our team doesn't manage access for Windows hosts.  We want to do sftp from Linux to Windows on these 3 servers. Since DistSys-SpecialMaint-WIN is maintaining these servsers  we need help in establishing sftp from Linux to Windows.

It was decided at that time to leave the problem ticket untouched for now until we have more answers. During the meeting  we determined that having multiple account numbers is valid although it's unusual and probably indicates a manual reindex.   In later IM's  we also found that this looks more like a UAT issue due to the lack of data controls in that environment. (See IM snippets below)  Hanson  Andrew [3:01 PM]:  ... However  I went over to Luther's desk and had a 5 minute conversation about the potential for multiple 'generic' records which would have the loan number. It normally shouldn't happen  but the system does allow for it  ... Hanson  Andrew [4:09 PM]:  Ok ICMP folks said this shouldn't happen unless there is a manual reindex to a new acct number  and that is pretty rare in production  would be a typo and we should use the latest acct record. This particular example is not a note  which will never have a signed date in production  it's bad UAT data because there aren't controls in place like production validation.  Based on yesterday's findings  it seems we may want to select the latest acct record if more than one exists. Andrew and Doug  do you agree?  If we're ok with that  I'll update the ticket with this information. 1453400350a111375Attaching Email for refernce .  1453400395a111375Pending Comments: recived reply from rochelle .refer Detail Section1454562038AR_ESCALATORSent follow-up date notification to assignee1455050322a111375From: Moran  Raymond  Sent: Tuesday  February 09  2016 2:40 PM To: Chourasia  Sachin Cc: Robinson  Douglas R.; Peters  Rochelle A.

When the soft delete indicator is set  the row is no longer valid. There might have been a home equity second as part of the deal at some point  but it was removed (hence soft delete) prior to the deal completing and the primary loan funding. I checked source for the loans below and they do NOT have a simultaneous second in CORE's product_request table.

Prachi found a number of instances where there were two rows for the same fee code. This caused a VCS issue  and will definitely cause a RESPA/TILA issue...as soon as CMIE come across it their code will fail.  On closer inspection the issue is not duplicate fee rows  it is that one row is for the valid current_applied_scenario_id and one is for a previous scenario_ID. I am not sure if the issue is the same as the one we had a few months back where the deltas are applied during the day but deletes are done at 5 am. I don't think it is since the issue there was that CORE had deleted the record. Here the issue is that MODE should have deleted the row when the product_request record changed and the row was no longer valid.  Here is SQL to find the current product_request_record for one of the loans: select product_request_ID from src_core2_deal.product_request join src_core2_deal.deal on deal.deal_id=product_request.deal_id where servicing_loan_acct_num=0423759927 and current_applied_scenario_id=scenario_id  This returns product_request_id 1028552318  In the fee_closing_cost table  for fee code 0855  we have two rows for that loan select *  from COM_ORIG_LOANS.FEE_CLS_COST_ITM  where srvcg_ln_acct_num= 0423759927  and fee_sor_cd=0855 and mode_soft_Del_ind is null  Loan number MODE_SURR_KY Fee 0423759927 1028201825 0855 Tax Service 0423759927 1041998079 0855 Tax Service  The MODE_SURR_KY is CLOSING_COST_ID in SRC. As you can see  when we check the SRC CLOSING_COST table  the product_request_id for the first one is 1028552317 not 1028552318. When the valid product_request_row changed  MODE should have removed the old row.  select * from src_core2_deal.closing_cost where closing_cost_id in (1028201825 1041998079)  MODE_SURR_KY PRODUCT_REQUEST_ID 1028201825  1028552317 1041998079  1028552318  Not sure how we handle issues that we find  problem ticket or is an email enough to start prod support on a Jira and research? This one needs to be address soon since it will cause downstream problems.  DESCRIPTION: IN FEE_CLS_COST_ITM  SUBJECT AREA  S2C DELTA PROCESS DIDNT MARK THE REPORTED LOAN WITH OLD PRODUCT ID AS SOFT DELETE BUT S2C REPROCESS DOES. NEED TO LOOK INTO ROOT CAUSE AND FIX IF REQUIRED  Problem was assigned to u414337 as a severity 4 problem.1438955938u414337These Deletes are not happening in the S2C delta and happening in the S2C delta reason becasue difference in identification of soft deletes between Delta and re process Jobs.  S2C Delta for the this subject area - fee_cls_cost_itm identifies the soft deletes based on the mode soft delete indicator received from the SRC_CORE2_DEAL tables. For the reported loan  below we didn't receive the soft delete from core on the old product request ID  But  In S2C reprocess which runs at 4 AM daily identifies the soft deletes based on the mode data  It compares the current refresh data from source to already existing data in COM for this subject area. Due to this   I am assuming this closing cost entry for old product id will be marked as soft delete after 4 am run because we will receive only new product ID entry in the 4 am run so during the comparison of this data with existing data(old and new product id row) in com causes the soft delete.  We verified 4 am run  - reprocess job  This loan with old product ID is deleted  select srvcg_ln_acct_num mode_surr_ky mode_soft_del_ind   from COM_ORIG_LOANS.FEE_CLS_COST_ITM  where srvcg_ln_acct_num= '0423759927'  and fee_sor_cd='0855'  SRVCG_LN_ACCT_NUM MODE_SURR_KY MODE_SOFT_DEL_IND MODE_LST_UPDT_DTTM 423759927 1028201825 Y 8/7/2015 6:56 423759927 1028209471 Y 8/7/2015 6:56 423759927 1041998079   8/6/2015 12:09   Will setup a meeting to discuss on this furthur 1438956262u414337Pending Comments: Will setup a meeting to discuss on this.
